# Packet Sniffer for ARP and Wi-Fi Monitoring

## Overview

This Python script is designed to monitor network traffic and detect potential security issues such as ARP spoofing attacks and identify new devices in a Wi-Fi network. It uses the `scapy` library to sniff packets and analyze ARP requests and replies, as well as 802.11 Wi-Fi packets.

### Key Features:
- **ARP Spoofing Detection**: Monitors ARP replies and checks for discrepancies in the IP-to-MAC address mapping. If an IP address associated with a MAC address changes unexpectedly, it flags this as a potential ARP spoofing attack.
- **Wi-Fi Device Detection**: Captures Wi-Fi packets to identify new devices that join the network, displaying their MAC address and SSID.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/packet-sniffer.git
    cd packet-sniffer
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    This script requires the `scapy` library, which can be installed using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install scapy
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:
    Ensure that you have root or sudo privileges to allow for sniffing network traffic.
    ```bash
    sudo python3 sniffer.py
    ```

## Usage

When you run the script, it will:
1. Start sniffing for ARP packets to detect possible ARP attacks.
2. Start sniffing for Wi-Fi packets and display new devices joining the network.

### ARP Spoofing Detection

The script will display messages if it detects an ARP attack:
```
Possible ARP attack detected!
MAC <MAC_ADDRESS> (previously <OLD_IP>) is pretending to be <NEW_IP>
```

### Wi-Fi Device Detection

The script will print information about any new devices detected:
```
New device detected: MAC <MAC_ADDRESS>, SSID: <SSID>
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library
- Root or sudo privileges (necessary for packet sniffing)

## Recommendations for Running

1. **Run as Root**: Ensure you have root access to capture network packets. Use `sudo` on Linux/macOS or run the script as Administrator on Windows with appropriate privileges.

2. **Monitor Mode**: For detecting Wi-Fi devices, you need to set your wireless adapter into monitor mode. This mode allows you to listen to all Wi-Fi traffic in range.

    **Linux**:
    - Use tools like `airmon-ng` to enable monitor mode on your wireless interface.
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
    ```

    **MacOS**:
    - Typically, MacOS should already support monitor mode for wireless interfaces.

3. **Run on a Dedicated Device**: If you're using the script for a security or monitoring purpose, consider running it on a dedicated machine or device that doesn't interfere with your regular work.

4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Ensure you have permission to monitor the network traffic, as sniffing and intercepting packets without consent can be illegal in some jurisdictions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Issues**: If you encounter a `PermissionError`, ensure you're running the script with root/sudo privileges.
- **No New Devices Detected**: Make sure your wireless adapter is in monitor mode and is within range of devices broadcasting Wi-Fi packets.

### Additional Recommendations:

1. **Add Logging**: Consider implementing a logging system (e.g., using Python’s `logging` module) to log detected events to a file for later analysis.
2. **Enhance Detection Mechanisms**: You can extend the ARP spoofing detection to include timestamp checks, logging suspicious behavior over time, or integrating more sophisticated attack detection mechanisms.
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: While the script should work on Linux and macOS, test it across different platforms and document any platform-specific requirements.
